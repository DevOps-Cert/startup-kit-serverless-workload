# AWS Startup Kit Serverless Workload

An example serverless application project:  a RESTful API backed by DynamoDB.

Components include multiple AWS Lambda functions, Amazon API Gateway, and an 
Amazon DynamoDB table.  The project uses the Lambda Node.js 6.10 runtime, and 
generally follows the ECMAScript 6 standard.  The AWS Serverless Application 
Model (SAM) is used to deploy the project. 

### LAUNCHING THE APP ON AWS:

#### Prerequisites

- [Install the AWS CLI](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html), or update
 the version you have installed previously (some commands used here may not
 exist in older versions of the AWS CLI).

- [Create an IAM user with admin access](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/getting-started_create-admin-group.html).
 The IAM user you associate with the AWS CLI should have admin permissions, including the ability to create IAM roles.

- [Configure the AWS CLI to use the admin user](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/configure/)




To begin your deployment, either download a zip file of the code from GitHub 
or clone the GitHub repository with the command:  

```

  git clone https://github.com/awslabs/startup-kit-serverless-workload.git

```


#### Use the installation script to deploy

You can use the installation script to deploy the app, or continue to the manual deployment section to deploy it manually.

The installation script (install.sh) is in the code you downloaded or cloned from this GitHub repository. First make sure the file has execution permission. You can grant the file execution permission by running the following command:

```
   
   chmod +x install.sh

```

Then you can run the installation script:

```
   
   ./install.sh

```

That's it!  Your Startup Kit Serverless Workload is now fully deployed and ready to be tested.
To test it, try the curl commands output by the installation script.  

NOTE:  if you test with a front end, the API should work fine with a mobile client such as iOS or Android
or when called from another server, but at present will not work with a web front end due to CORS issues. 
To enable CORS on API Gateway when deploying with SAM, include a Swagger file as show in the example
https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model/tree/master/examples/2016-10-31/api_swagger_cors.


#### Manual deployment

To understand the steps involved in an AWS SAM deployment, deploy the workload
manually.  Once you have a S3 bucket in place to hold deployment artifacts, the 
workflow for using AWS SAM primarily consists of using just two AWS CLI commands.  

In the AWS Region where you plan to do your deployment, be sure you have an 
existing Amazon S3 bucket in which SAM can put the deployment artifacts, or 
create a new bucket using the following AWS CLI command:  

```

  aws s3 mb s3://<your-bucket-name>.  
  
```

Next, to deploy the project for the first time with SAM, and for each subsequent 
code update, run both of the following AWS CLI commands in order.  For the 
first command, package, replace the s3-bucket argument with the name of your 
S3 bucket.  For the second command, deploy, replace the template-file argument 
with the full path to your output template file.

```

aws cloudformation package \
--template-file serverless.cfn.yml \
--output-template-file serverless-xfm.cfn.yml \
--s3-bucket <your-bucket-name>

aws cloudformation deploy \
--template-file <path-to-file/serverless-xfm.cfn.yml> \
--stack-name StartupKitServerless \
--capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM

```

### TESTING THE APP:

First get the invoke URL of your API.  Do this by going to the API Gateway console, 
selecting StartupKitServerless, then Stages in the left navigation panel, and finally 
Stage in the list of stages.  The invoke URL should now appear at the top of the right 
hand panel.  

Begin testing by adding some TODO items using the create API.  This may be
accomplished using the following command: 

```

   curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"todo_id": "1001", "active": true, "description": "What TODO next?"}' https://<invoke-URL-for-your-API>/todo/new
   
```

To fetch the active TODO items you created, execute the following command:

```

   curl https://<invoke-URL-for-your-API>/todo/active

```

Similar commands can be used to test all of the other API calls.

NOTE:  if you test with a front end, the API should work fine with a mobile client such as iOS or Android
or when called from another server, but at present will not work with a web front end due to CORS issues. 
To enable CORS on API Gateway when deploying with SAM, include a Swagger file as show in the example
https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model/tree/master/examples/2016-10-31/api_swagger_cors.
